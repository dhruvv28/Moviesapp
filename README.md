git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-flutter-movie-app.git
cd your-flutter-movie-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get

### 4. Configure API Key (if needed)
- If the API requires an API key, create a file (like `secrets.dart`) and add your key:

- Make sure to **secure your API key** and avoid pushing it to public repos.
